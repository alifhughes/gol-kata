## Design justification and process

In this file I hope to document my creation process and justify any notable design decisions.

### Process

1. Created package.json file
    - Hope to add npm start script to it if front end is created
2. Initialised git repository
    - added `node_modules` directory and `npm-log` to the `.gitignore`
    - Initial commit

### Design justification

**TDD approach:**

Wish to attempt this with the _Test-driven Development_ methodology as it helps me to define exactly what is needed from functions, and therefore makes the functions more concise and clear. It also makes the program as a whole more robust and one would assume eventually leads to faster development of features. Personally, as stated, it helps me to not get overwhelmed and forces me to think through exactly what is needed, rather than jumping straight into the code.
